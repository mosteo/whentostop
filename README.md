Here is a list of Agatha Christie's novels that I have read. If you wonder at
which point you should make your final hypothesis on the murderer, or you like
to discuss theories with a fellow reader on equal footing, this table will indicate in which chapter
happens the reveal. That is, you should stop reading at the end of the previous
chapter.

| Title | Year | Chapters | Reveal |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Crooked House | 1949 | 26 | ? |
